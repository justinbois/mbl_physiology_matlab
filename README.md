## Notes
The `gene_expression` module contains code to process a stack of images acquired by Tal Einav at Caltech.  The raw images can be downloaded [here](http://bois.caltech.edu/bootcamp/2016-05-13_tal_dryrun.zip).  When running the main script, be sure you have unpackaged the images and have the appropriate directory structure.  After image processing, the results are stored in CSV files that can be downloaded [here](http://bois.caltech.edu/bootcamp/gene_expression_dryrun.zip).  The MLX files are then used to process these results.

The `ecoli_growth` module contains analysis of an *E. coli* growth movie obtained by Muir Morrison at Caltech.  The raw images can be obtained [here](http://bois.caltech.edu/bootcamp/2016-04-03-muir_dryrun.zip).  A CSV file of the resulting time points and areas may be found [here](http://bois.caltech.edu/bootcamp/ecoli_growth.csv).
